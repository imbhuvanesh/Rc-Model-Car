RC Model Car Prototype

An Arduino-based Bluetooth-controlled RC car that moves forward, backward, left, and right using the HC-05 module and L298N motor driver.

Components: Arduino Uno, L298N, DC Motors, HC-05, Battery, Chassis.
Control: Smartphone app via Bluetooth.
Core Logic:

‘F’ → Forward

‘B’ → Backward

‘L’ → Left

‘R’ → Right

Upgrades: Add sensors for obstacle detection, IoT control, or camera module for live streaming.
